Week 4: Expense Tracker Management with Data Manipulation Language (DML)
Questions (2 hours):
1.1. Adding a New Expense
INSERT INTO Expenses (amount, date, category)
VALUES (50.00, '2024-08-11', 'Groceries');
1.2. Updating an Expense
UPDATE Expenses
SET amount = 60.00, date = '2024-08-12', category = 'Entertainment'
WHERE expense_id = 1;
1.3. Simulating Data Deletion
Step 1: Create a Copy of the Expenses Table
CREATE TABLE Expenses_Copy AS
SELECT * FROM Expenses;
Step 2: Delete a Record from the Copy
DELETE FROM Expenses_Copy
WHERE expense_id = 1;
Bonus Challenge: Handling NULL Values
Checking for null values:
SELECT *
FROM Expenses
WHERE amount IS NULL OR date IS NULL OR category IS NULL;
Handling null values:
UPDATE Expenses
SET amount = 0
WHERE amount IS NULL;
